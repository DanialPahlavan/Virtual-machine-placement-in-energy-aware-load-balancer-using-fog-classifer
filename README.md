# Virtual Machine Placement in Energy-Aware Load Balancer Using Fog Classifier

Welcome to the repository containing the Python implementation of the innovative algorithm for virtual machine (VM) placement in an energy-aware load balancer. This implementation is inspired by the research article titled "Virtual machine placement in energy-aware load balancer using fog classifier" authored by S. Selvaganapathy and M. Chinnadurai.

## Overview

In the realm of data centers, efficient resource utilization is paramount. This algorithm is designed to optimize the placement of VMs across hosts, ensuring a harmonious balance between energy efficiency and load distribution. The process is meticulous and considers the following phases:

1. **Host Categorization**: Hosts are classified as either under-utilized or over-utilized, guided by a predefined utilization threshold.
2. **Workload Computation**: The algorithm computes the aggregate workload of the data center to inform decision-making.
3. **VM Allocation**: VMs are allocated to hosts in an iterative manner, with a focus on minimizing the incremental power consumption.
4. **Migration Mapping**: A comprehensive migration map is generated, detailing the allocation of VMs to their respective hosts.
